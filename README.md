I wanted to learn a front end frame work and decided to go with React.js. While working on this porject I learn alot of fundementals of React such as hooks, props, class system, and router. I wanted to make it a functional ecommerce site but with lack of product to sell I decided to make it only display pictures that I took. Always wanting to try out firebase I decided to use "firestore" in order to create and use my realational database. I then wanted to remove the locla images build package and decided to use "firebase storage" and download images on each use. This worked pretty easy but created a lag on the image loading and I have not figured out a way to fix it. Since this is just a side project there is still a few bugs that could be fixed and doesn't have supprot for mobile.
